					<h1> the notion that I am enlightened, or any better than anyone else, is simply a result of a higher sense of self worth and being, which is unrealistic. I'm not better than anybody else, I'm not any different than anybody else, homeless or rich or productive or useless, every person is an asset, every life is an asset.</h1>
					<p style="color: gold; font-size: 46px"> this has little to nothing to do with the fact that I'm enlightened, which is a phallacy and social construct created by a false sense of being and self worth. Nothing is worth being for, there is no reason to improve my being.</p>
					<p style="color: gold; font-size: 46px"> there isn't much reason to be, but I'm used to it. by extension that makes me scared of the alternative, even when I shouldn't be</p>
					<p style="color: gold; font-size: 46px"> death is inevitable, and ergo almost nothing and everything matters simultaneously.</p>
