				<p style ="font-size: 40px;"> I don't hit dogs. to be real. I just pretend to be meaner than I am because it keeps me safe, I just want to be okay, I just want to be safe, I just want to be okay, </p>
				<p> I'm waiting for somebody to tell me where I went wrong, I simply don't understand and at this point barely feel a thing. I just want to understand where things went askew, where I lost my life, where I fell apart</p>
				<p> last time I hit a dog was about 6-8 years ago, when I was a child, and I was scolded for it absolutely and harshly, and that's okay. </p>
				<p> I didn't perform correctly, I was cruel and unnecessarily so, I don't know where I need to go, I don't know what holds my freedon, but I stay as kind as I can be, to all creatures, to all people</p>
				<p> but realistically, it doesn't matter </p>
